# WELCOME TO THE ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME
## Made possible by Jess

##How to play
It's pretty straight forward.
An opponent is randomly selected from the database and you duel it out in a best of 3.
Records are kept in the database, along with stat bonuses. (Those will show up in a later update)
The game is just a simple python script, so you must have python installed to run it.
Later I may make it a more colorful UI for it, but since I didn't want to limit it to Linux users.

+ INPUTS
..+ rock
..+ paper
..+ scissors

Thank you have a great day.
